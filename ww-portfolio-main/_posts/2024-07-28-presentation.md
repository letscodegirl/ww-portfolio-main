**<u>Enhancing Presentation Impact Through Non-Verbal Communication for Non-Native English Speakers</u>**

*By Erick Mendoza*

For the past decade, I have taught Business Presentation Skills to 3rd and 4th-year Business students who are non-native English speakers. At the start of each semester, I pose a question to the class: “When giving a presentation, what is the most important thing to consider?” Despite the varied responses, none give the answer I seek: 'the audience.' The most important thing to consider is the audience. Without their engagement, if they are not listening or following, you are essentially just speaking to yourself.

The challenge then becomes how to keep the audience engaged. One of the most effective methods I train students on is the use of non-verbal skills. Mastering elements such as eye contact, body language, vocal variety, overall stage presence, and timing of delivery can transform a presentation from a simple lecture into a memorable experience. Non-native English speakers often find these skills particularly challenging. The main hurdles for most come down to vocal variety, intonation, and emphasis of words, along with the speed of delivery, and strategic pauses.

The variation of the voice is very important in keeping the audience engaged. Research has shown that the addition of non-verbal communication or skills significantly impacts the presentation since audiences who perceive a speaker as confident and engaging are more likely to pay attention and retain information. Non-verbal skills reinforce the message, leading to better understanding and recall. The effective use of facial expressions and strategic pauses can create emotional connections, making the information more memorable.

I have had the opportunity to train thousands of university students and a few professionals who had to give a product presentation in English. To overcome these challenges, I suggest the following: First, have a native speaker perform the presentation and record it. Use this recording as a guide, mimic it until you perfect your delivery. However, if you are not acquainted with a native speaker, then find a presentation video on social media that you can emulate. Second, visualize everything in your mind, from start to finish, the way you want it to be. Third, practice repeatedly. Ensure you can deliver every line, intonation, movement, and timing seamlessly. When you are practicing, if you still have to think about the next step or the next part, then you are not ready. The nerves and fear that come when facing an audience can disrupt your flow which can lead to an avalanche of errors. And finally, the last step is to make the presentation fit your style or your personality. As I teach in Sales, if you say it, you need to believe it, because if you don’t believe, neither will the audience.

The non-verbal skills in a presentation are not limited to just the vocal variety. Non-verbal skills include eye contact, body language, posture, hand movements, and so on. However, vocal variety is often the most challenging for non-native English speakers to deal with.

Overall, research supports the strong link between effective non-verbal communication and audience retention. The importance of non-verbal communication on presentations cannot be overstated. In a world where attention is fleeting, and competition for it is fierce, sharpening your non-verbal communication skills is not just beneficial—it is a must! Your ability to connect, engage, and leave a lasting impression on your audience relies on these often-overlooked skills. The question is, will you take the steps necessary to ramp-up your presentations that will truly make an impact and captivate your audience?
