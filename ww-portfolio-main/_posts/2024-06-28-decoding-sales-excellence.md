### **Decoding Sales Excellence (An opinion piece)**

### **By: Erick Mendoza**

What does it take to be a great salesperson? Traditional characteristics like charisma, an extroverted personality, and the ability to close deals have long been declared qualities belonging to great salespeople. From my ten years of sales experience, I would agree that these are all good traits to have. However, I would declare that they are not as essential as the following:

### **<u>Persistence</u>**:

There is a clear connection between the volume of sales activities (calls, emails, meetings) and overall sales performance. It’s not just about having a silver tongue with the extrovert personality and being the life of the party, but the relentless pursuit of opportunities that separates salespeople. It’s logical to assume that high levels of activity will provide more chances to engage prospects, set meetings, and close deals. This is, after all, an old adage that success in sales is, to a significant extent, just a numbers game. Therefore, the trait of persistence—to be able to keep pushing, keep making calls, sending emails, and not get discouraged by rejections—sets exceptional salespeople apart.

### **<u>The principle of working smarter, not harder:</u>**

This implies the importance of having a strategic focus and prioritizing high-value tasks, activities, and prospects to maximize results. With all the data-driven information available today, having insights into which activities or tasks will yield the highest returns will enable salespeople to focus and harness their efforts efficiently. Thus, great salespeople are not just productive in their actions but in their strategic executions as well.

### **<u>Adaptability</u>**:

This is a crucial trait to have in today’s dynamic landscape. It is the ability to adjust strategies as you see fit. Because great salespeople are not rigid; rather, they continuously keep learning, adjusting, and refining their methods and approach based on feedback, observation, personal experience, and in understanding the changing market conditions they are in. Let’s face it, sales would be a lot easier if all clients fell for the same approach, lines, small talk, and closing techniques, but they do not. The truth is, every sales situation is different. Thus, this characteristic ensures great salespeople remain relevant and competitive regardless of whatever external changes might come.

### **<u>The ability to build genuine business relationships:</u>**

This, in my opinion, is the most important part of the sales process—the concept of building a real business relationship with your client. This is not just about spending more time with your clients but about strategic engagements that create a better understanding of the client's needs, fears, desires, and wants. If you can truly understand your client's business inside out, then you can offer products or services that will solve problems before they arise, and that is my definition of having a deeper, genuine business relationship.

The notion of “quality versus quantity” exemplifies this example. Top salespeople build stronger relationships with fewer accounts, allowing for more impactful engagements with each client. This generates repeat business and leads to more positive and warm referrals. Other salespeople focus more on quantity, but their deals are more one-time transactions because of the shallower relationships that were built.

### **Conclusion:**

Thus, overall, great salespeople are more persistence, work smarter, adaptable, and build stronger, long-term business relationships with their clients, not by simply spending more time with them, but by having more strategic engagements which ultimately lead to better sales results.
