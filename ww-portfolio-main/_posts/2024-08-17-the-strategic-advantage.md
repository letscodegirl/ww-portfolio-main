## **<u>The Strategic Advantage of Business English Training for Non-Native English Speaking Professionals, Startups, and Small Businesses</u>**

By Erick Mendoza

Effective communication is one of the factors for success in today’s interconnected global economy. For non-native English speakers, being able to communicate fluently and persuasively in English is not just an asset; it’s a must! Thus, the value of hiring a professional Business English skills trainer who can assist in the growth of your Business cannot be overstated. Here are key reasons why Business English skills training is vital for your growth and success.

#### **1\. Enhancing Professional Competence and Confidence**

For new professionals who have just graduated and are entering the workforce, being proficient in Business English is crucial, especially if your company deals with international clients. According to the Harvard Business Review, companies that invest in Business English or some type of communication training see up to a 25% increase in productivity from their employees. For a non-native English-speaking professional, this could translate into quicker promotion or career advancement, and greater organizational influence.

Because English remains the main language used in international business, with over 1.5 billion people using it worldwide, a strong command of the English language can significantly reduce misunderstandings and create stronger relationships with your international clients. Training in Business English that is focused on sales and negotiation will equip new professionals with the process, vocabulary, idioms, and cultural nuances needed to close deals and build long-term business partners. Furthermore, these skills will instill confidence, that will enable you to participate actively in meetings, present ideas clearly, and assert yourself more in competitive environments.

#### **2\. Boosting Startup Success through Strategic Communication**

Startups are faced with numerous challenges. The issues can arise from securing funding to scaling operations, and even with language barriers. According to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, language barriers were identified as an obstacle for startups looking to expand their market overseas. In a competitive business environment, being able to communicate clearly and persuasively becomes the difference, or as they say, the game changer. By investing in Business English training, startups can overcome this hurdle, improve their chances of entering new markets, and form overseas strategic partnerships.

**RAMP** offers Business English training that will be modified or tailored to the needs of your employees and the industry you belong in. As such, it would be particularly beneficial for startups looking to pitch their ideas to investors, partners, or clients overseas to have Business English training. A pitch that is well-prepared and rehearsed, that is delivered in clear, proficient business English will serve as the difference between getting that funding or missing out on the opportunity.

Additionally, presentation skills training can assist everyone in the company, from the founders to the employees, to express their vision more compellingly and persuasively. If you’re at an industry event, product launch, or when you’re on a virtual meeting, the ability to present confidently in English is a necessity because it will reflect not only your professionalism but also your credibility in the eyes of the stakeholders.

#### **3\. Empowering Small Businesses to Compete Globally**

Small businesses sometimes or maybe often, are challenged with limited resources. This makes it important to maximize the impact of every business interaction. A study by EF Education First found that companies with higher levels of English proficiency are 30% more likely to engage in global business activities than those with lower proficiency. For small businesses, this highlights the substantial benefits of investing in language training as a means to achieve corporate goals.

Acquiring the services of a professional Business English trainer can equip small business owners and their teams with the necessary skills to easily navigate international markets. Whether it’s dealing with contract negotiation, dealing with overseas suppliers, or attending international trade shows, being able to communicate in English effectively can significantly increase your chances of success.

Small businesses frequently participate in international exhibitions or conventions to showcase their products or services. Business English training for executing a successful overseas convention can guarantee that your presence and presentation at the events are clear, professional, and culturally sensitive. This would help in building trust and rapport with international clients. This level of preparation can set a small business apart from its competitors which could ripple into opportunities for expansion and increased revenue.

#### **4\. Facilitating Seamless Execution of International Events**

Participating in an international convention or event will demand that your entire team can effectively communicate with international clients or prospective buyers. Thus, the company and its employees need to make sure that all aspects of the event, from the prospect interaction to the presentations are done smoothly and professionally. For example, understanding the different English versions used in various regions can assist in avoiding miscommunication that could spoil or mess up the interaction. Moreover, being able to present in English confidently guarantees that your message will have more impact and will connect further with the international audience.

According to the International Congress and Convention Association (ICCA), the number of international association meetings has more than doubled in the last decade. The value of business English training can be seen in this growing trend of companies participating in international conventions as a means to gain exposure, venture into a new market, and create new partnerships. Companies that are well-trained in the dominant language of business will find themselves in a better position to take advantage of these opportunities.

#### **Conclusion: An Investment in Future Success**

To conclude, investing in a professional training service like **RAMP: Business English Skills Training** will be a strategic investment for non-native English-speaking professionals, startups, and small businesses that need to work or are interested in gaining international clients/buyers. The benefits, which include improved individual confidence, business competence, increased revenue growth, company, and team empowerment to compete on a global level, and the successful execution of international conventions, I guarantee will far outweigh the dreaded cost. In the current business environment, where English is still the dominant language, devoting and investing in Business English training will be more than learning a language; it will be about securing a competitive position in the global market.

Therefore, any company or professional that needs or desires to do business with international clients and wants to succeed, should acquire this valuable skill. Because as the global economy becomes more inter-connected, the demand for English proficiency will only increase, making Business English training an essential component of professional and organizational development.
