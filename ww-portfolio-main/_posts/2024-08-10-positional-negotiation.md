### **<u>The Strengths and Weaknesses of Positional Negotiation in Business: An introduction to a negotiation approach</u>**

*by Erick Mendoza*

Positional negotiation is a common approach in business negotiations that I’ve been teaching for the last 10 years, which is characterized by parties taking fixed positions and negotiating within its parameters, often making concessions when necessary to gain advantages over issues that matter. While this method can be effective in certain scenarios, it also has drawbacks. Understanding both the strengths and weaknesses of any negotiation approach or technique is essential for professionals who are aiming to optimize their negotiation strategies.

**Strengths of Positional Negotiation**

**Clarity and Simplicity:** Positional negotiation provides a framework where each party’s demands and offers are explicitly clear. This can simplify the negotiation process, making it easier to understand each side’s stance or position and what is at stake.

**Protection of Interests:** By sticking firmly to a position, parties can ensure their fundamental interests are protected. This is particularly important in negotiations involving critical assets or non-negotiable terms, such as intellectual property or core business practices.

**Strategic Concessions**: I have often emphasized many times that in positional negotiation, concessions are often used strategically. This can allow a party to appear cooperative while actually gaining favorable terms on the most important issues, which can be advantageous in competitive business environments. For example, one company might deem pricing to be a more important issue in comparison to payment terms. Therefore, if one company acting as the seller can be more flexible on payment terms and determines that the opposing party regards it as important, they can concede on the payments terms under the condition of acquiring better pricing.

**Clear Parameters and Outcomes**: If there is more than one member in a negotiation team, and if set-up correctly, each member should clearly see the boundaries of each issue. This implies that the company or the negotiating team will determine the starting point of the negotiation, the initial offer to give, the target point, and the bottom line of each issue that is up for negotiation. Thus, an offer can be accepted, countered, or rejected depending on its importance to the party or where the offer places in the pre-determined boundaries that were set. Then, when negotiations are concluded, the results are usually straightforward and specific. This can reduce doubt and ensure that both parties have a mutual understanding of the agreed terms, aiding in implementation and compliance.

**Suitability for Competitive Negotiations**: In highly competitive or adversarial situations, positional negotiation can be effective. It allows each party to firmly advocate for their interests, which can be critical in situations where one party’s gain is the other’s loss.

**Weaknesses of Positional Negotiation**

**Potential for Deadlock**: One of the significant drawbacks of positional negotiation is the potential for impasse. When both parties strictly stick to their positions, it can lead to deadlock, making it difficult to reach an agreement. In this situation, parties must determine the source of conflict, resolve it creatively, and try to keep a win-win mentality. However, if one party continues to do this for every issue, then it becomes problematic, which leads to a strained relationship.

**Strained Relationships**: This approach can create adversarial relationships between the negotiating parties. The focus on winning concessions can lead to doubt, mistrust, and resentment, which can be harmful to any potential for long-term business relationships and any sort of future collaborations.

**Suboptimal Outcomes**: Positional negotiation can often overlook underlying interests and needs, focusing instead on fixed demands or positions of each party. This can result in suboptimal agreements that fail to solve the broader concerns of both parties, potentially leaving value on the table. However, if you understand that this is one of the drawbacks of positional negotiation, then it can easily be ameliorated by being cognizant of the opposing sides needs and interest.

**Time-Consuming and Costly**: Prolonged positional negotiations can be time-consuming and costly. The back-and-forth bargaining can extend negotiations, increasing expenses related to time, resources, and legal fees.

**Lack of Flexibility:** Some argue that positional negotiation is rigid, with little room for creative solutions. This rigidity can prevent parties from exploring alternative options that might benefit both sides, limiting the potential for innovative and mutually beneficial agreements. But I happen to disagree with this notion. I think there are a lot of opportunities in positional negotiation where both parties can arrive at creative solutions especially during a deadlock. The key is in understand the opposing sides situation, and while keeping your positions in mind, find a creative solution that works for everyone involved.

To give a simplistic example, let’s say that a tenant and a landlord or a lessor and lessee are at a deadlock on the rent payment issue of a 10-year property lease. The lessee would like to pay lower rent for the first 3 years until they get established. But the lessor wants to make sure that the property generates fair market rate over the duration of the lease term. Neither one is willing to budge. In positional negotiation, if the rent issue is important for both side, then it could be considered a deal breaker unless you get creative with the solution. Understanding the lessee’s concern, the lessor can provide the ideal lower rate for the first three years contingent upon gradual yearly rent increases or bumps that will produce the average fair market rate over the 10 year term of the lease. Both sides win.

**Balancing Positional and Interest-Based Negotiation**

While positional negotiation has its place, integrating elements of interest-based negotiation (also known as integrative or principled negotiation) can often yield better results. Interest-based negotiation focuses on the underlying interests and needs of both parties rather than fixed positions. By understanding and addressing these interests, parties can find common ground and develop solutions that provide mutual benefits.

Combining the strengths of both approaches can lead to more effective negotiations. For instance, parties can start with positional negotiation to outline their primary demands and then transition to interest-based techniques to explore underlying concerns and potential win-win outcomes.

**Conclusion**

Positional negotiation remains a prevalent strategy in business, offering clear advantages in terms of clarity, strategic concessions, and suitability for competitive environments. However, its weaknesses, such as the potential for deadlock, strained relationships, and suboptimal outcomes, cannot be ignored. Business professionals should consider a balanced approach, incorporating interest-based negotiation principles to enhance flexibility, foster collaborative relationships, and achieve more comprehensive and mutually satisfying agreements. By doing so, they can navigate the complexities of business negotiations more effectively, ensuring both immediate and long-term success.
