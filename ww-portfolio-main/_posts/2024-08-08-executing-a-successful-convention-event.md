# Executing A Successful Overseas Convention Event

*by Erick Mendoza*&nbsp;

&nbsp;**<u>Executing a Successful Overseas Convention Event: Training non-native English speaking Business Teams</u>**

As a former business development specialist for one of the largest financial institutions in the United States, I have a good amount of experience with convention events. Combining a decade of experience in corporate America, specifically in sales to affluent doctors and dentists, with a 15-year tenure in training and educating non-native English speakers in sales, negotiations, presentation skills for business, and consumer behavior, combined with a Master’s degree in Business Management from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, and a Master’s degree in Counseling, I have created a training program tailored for business teams from non-native English-speaking countries preparing for overseas convention events.

**Detailed Preparation**

Execution of a successful overseas convention event requires meticulous preparation and strategic engagement, especially when targeting an international and English-speaking audience. A successful convention actually starts long before the event itself with detailed preparation. First, the team should research the target audience of the convention and understand their needs. Then, the team should set clear objectives, such as the number of leads to generate or meetings to schedule, so every member is focused on the goals. Finally, preparing engaging marketing materials in English and additionally, training all team members to be well-versed in the company's products and services is essential. This preparation enables them to clearly articulate the value propositions to potential clients.

**Booth Setup**

Then you have the booth setup which is another critical element. An attractive and eye-catching booth design, featuring visuals, banners, and digital displays, can significantly enhance visibility and draw in visitors. Incorporating interactive elements like product demos, videos, or interactive screens engages visitors and keeps them in your booth. Booth branding consistency ensures that the company’s message is clear and memorable.

**Drawing in Potential Clients**

If you’ve set-up the booth correctly, then the next hurdle with be drawing in potential clients. This involves positioning your booth strategically, ideally in high-foot traffic locations, if possible. As potential clients are passing by, the team members need to be trained to use friendly and engaging opening lines that can affectively start conversations.

Offering promotional items such as pens and notepads can also pull-in visitors to the booth. Effective communication is the key, which implies that team members must be active listeners, able to ask open-ended questions, and learn to read between the lines to understand the buyer needs. These are key components of a successful engagement of a potential client. Then, team members must be able to clearly explain the company's products or services, as well as emphasize their benefits. Providing a product demonstration can give a better understanding of their benefits, which is often more persuasive than a verbal description alone.

**Building Relationships and Closing**

Building relationships with potential clients involves more than just presenting your products. Team members should focus on creating personal connections, building rapport with visitors, being culturally sensitive, and maintaining politeness and professionalism. Collecting potential buyers’ contact information is vital, and personalized follow-up communication increases the chances of converting leads into clients.

Closing conversations effectively is also important; ending with a clear call to action, such as scheduling a meeting or signing up for a demo, ensures that the interaction has a defined next step. Summarizing key points discussed and providing necessary information and materials will further solidify the interaction.

**Handling Objections**

Another crucial skill is training non-native English-speaking business teams to handle objections effectively. Every team member should be prepared with responses to common objections while staying positive and maintaining confidence. For example, a common objection by most prospect is, “Just send me more information in the mail or email.” Most people would say yes, collect the information, either a physical address or email and bid the prospect farewell. But a better response would be, “*That’s great, but you know what, how about if I deliver that information to you personally, and if you have time, I can take you out to lunch, and we can review the information as we’re eating, so that if any questions come up for you, then I can answer it right then and there. This will also allow me to find out more information about your needs. I’m still in town tomorrow, does 11 or 12 pm lunch sound good for you?*” As you can see, by responding in this manner, you keep control of the conversation, and engage the prospect to make a call of action.

And it is also okay to not have an answer to an objection, so don’t despair. This presents an opportunity for you to collect the prospect’s contact information with a promise to follow-up and deliver a satisfactory answer.

**Post-Convention Follow-Up**

This brings us to post-convention follow-ups with the prospects. Timely and personalized follow-ups are essential to maintain the momentum gained during the convention. This means that reaching out within a few days keeps the interaction fresh in everyone’s mind. When you do the follow-up communication, personalize it based on the conversations you had at the booth, because it shows a genuine interest, and your strong attention to detail.
